  You completed the game and hopefully learned something 
  about logic gate. Ohhh yeah you also defeated the evil AI Mechs 
  they were nothing. Anyhow Thanks for playing this absolute
  ass of a game. I haven't made lot of games and this was quite
  fun experience. I also didn't want to make it this bad. It's just 
  I was procrastinating. Nonetheless Thanks Again !
  Also send/post your time-taken to complete :).
